# neovim config files

## Synopsis

These are my neovim configuration files, they are evolving and carry no
guarantees of stability.

## Development

The makefile contains two targets: `all` and `install`. `make all` is reserved
for my use (it copies the original config files over to the repo). `make
install` copies the files from this repo to your home folder, if you don't have
an existing neovim config. I encourage you to create your own config and use
mine for inspiration, however, since it'll allow you to get a better
understanding of how (neo)vim is set up.
